# KMl_2_route_sim
Java / processing utility to convert Google KML maps to gpx routes with speed values. 
I use it with Xcode to simulate gps movments while debuging apps. 

There is a packaged .app in the application.macosx.
To run you need some Java (8):  http://java.com/en/download/

The .pde can be compiled by loading it and running in processing.
